## HW2:
2. 12.3/15

3. Part1		
- Task 1 (3 points)	-	3
- Task 2 (7 points)	-	7
- Task 3 (30 points)	-	30

Total	-	82

## HW3:
5. 14.76/20

- Task 1 ok
- Task 2 ok
- Task 3 ok, faces in VAE aren't good -3 points for that, +1 points for bonus
- Task 4  you didn't make all necessary experiments in Task4: GP +- BN, SN +- BN, and +- BN, -3 points for that
and you didn't provide faces you generated from GAN, I don't know how to assess your Task 4


- Task 1 (10 points)	-	10	0,9
